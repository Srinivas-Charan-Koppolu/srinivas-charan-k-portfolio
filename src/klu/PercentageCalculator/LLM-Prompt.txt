I have a subject and its raw evaluation data. Each component has a name, weightage, and max marks, but the data may be unstructured. I want to generate a JavaScript function call in this exact format:

addSubjectTemplate("SubjectName",
  ["Component1 Name", Component1 Weightage, Component1 MaxMarks],
  ["Component2 Name", Component2 Weightage, Component2 MaxMarks],
  ...
);

Only include the function call, no extra text.

Here is an example:

Input (raw table):
Skill Sem-End Exam	
Weightage
8
Max Marks
50

Lab End Semester Exam	
Weightage
8
Max Marks
50

End Semester Exam	
Weightage
24
Max Marks
100

Desired Output:
addSubjectTemplate("ExampleSubject",
  ["Skill Sem-End Exam", 8, 50],
  ["Lab End Semester Exam", 8, 50],
  ["End Semester Exam", 24, 100]
);

Now, generate the function call for the following subject and give in your copy code block:
